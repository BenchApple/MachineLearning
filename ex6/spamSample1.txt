Dear Benjamin,

Maybe you’ve heard of us; maybe you haven’t.
 
We don’t want students to choose us because of who we are. We want them to choose us because of what we are. We are a university whose alumni have won Oscars, Pulitzers, and Super Bowls. We are a preeminent research institution whose undergraduates explore, collaborate, and publish with enthusiastic and engaged faculty mentors who are award-winners and recognized leaders in their fields. We are a top-20 liberal arts college that not only allows but actively encourages students to question the status quo and disrupt the lines between disciplines to create new connections and open up new lines of thought and innovation.
 
But the true energy source of our school isn’t on campus.
 
Yet.
 
It’s the next class of surprising, creative, brave students who will be joining us next year. The kind who’d check out a website from a school that wouldn’t even tell them its name.
